# RESTFUL Shoes Practice

### Shoes API
Build out a full RESTful Flask API for a shoes resource with a model, migration(s), routes, resource classes and view methods.  Shoes should have the following properties:
```python
{
    "brand": str,
    "style": str,
    "size": float,
    "color": str,
    "inventory": int
}
```
Test all 5 of your routes with Postman or another API Client.

### BONUS
Add error handling to your routes.
